# CS312_Raycaster
The raycaster version of the 312 raytracer, written in C++. Includes lighting! 

![some spheres produced with the program](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tablackwell/CSCI312_Raytracer/master/Example%20Images/example.png)

The program can be compiled with the command:g++ rt.cppVector.cpp Sphere.cpp Light.cpp –lm –o rt


..and run with the command: ./rt <spheres.txt> img.ppm

Two example sphere(s) input files are included in the appropriately named folders. Run it using them, or change it around to see how they turn out!

Disclaimer: If you're a CSCI312 student looking at this, please don't copy my code. You're better than that. I have no clue if CSCI312 still uses this project anyways.
